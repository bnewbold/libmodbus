First build and install the actual library in the parent directory:
    
    cd ..
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Then build and run this program:

    ./make.sh
    ./example

If you get an "error while loading shared libraries" you probably need to add
/usr/local/lib to your operating system's shared library search path.
